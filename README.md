#LiveAPI ~ backend

LiveAPI is an app created to examine if API's are running successfully or if the API's are currently redundant. 

The general idea of the app was generated by the team discussing issues we have been through throughout the bootcamp and what we can do to resolve it. 

Users can also add an API, delete an API, recieve links to the DOCS and also recieve data in a JSON file.
## Tech Stack 
What we used on the backend consisted of:
```
React
```




## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
By doing this, users can have access to fully maximise the app itself

In the backend, there are dependencies and dev dependencies to install. These are the dependencies to install:

```
express 
pg 
```
The dev dependencies to install are:

```
dotenv 
morgan
nodemon 
jest  
```

## Running Tests

As a group, we made several tests to make sure the code we wrote was running the way we wanted it to

To run tests, run the following command

```
  npm run test
```
